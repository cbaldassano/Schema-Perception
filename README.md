# Readme
This code repository demonstrates the analyses described in "Representation of real-world event schemas during narrative perception" by Baldassano, Hasson, and Norman. An executable version of the code (with ROI data) is available as [a Code Ocean capsule](https://codeocean.com/algorithm/a27d1d90-d227-4600-b876-051a801c7c20/).

## Fig 2 analysis
Fig2.py implements the event pattern correlation analysis for one ROI. It has one command line argument: the name of the ROI to be analyzed.

## Fig 3 analysis
Fig3.py implements the schema classification analysis. It has two command line arguments: the name of the ROI to be analyzed and the number of bootstrap samples to compute.

## Fig 4 analysis
Fig4.py implements the unsupervised alignment analysis. It has one command line argument: the name of the ROI to be analyzed.
